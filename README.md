This repository contains numerous numerical methods implemented in MATLAB to accomplish different tasks. Below is a list of the files and their purpose.


### Finite DIfference Methods folder

This folder contains various finite difference method schemes. 
BTCS - Backwards finite difference in time, centered difference in space.
CSCS - 2D Centered difference in space.
CTCS - Centered differences in both time and space.
FTBS - Forward difference in time and backward difference in space.
FTCS - Forward difference in time and centered difference in space.
FTFS - Forward dfference in time and space.

### Ising.m


### EandRK.m
